- [x] Devices have a unique ID. (MQTT send client.id)
- [x] Devices generate periodically changing pseudorandom.
- [x] Mini-Connector should dynamically detect available devices.
- [x] Use TypeScript.
- [x] Establish a secure connection between devices and the Mini-Connector.
- [x] Validate device messages using any form of checksum.
- [ ] The Mini-Connector accepts user-input to interact with the devices.
- [ ] The Mini-Connector manages the process-lifecycle of the devices. It can start and stop
  devices dynamically.
